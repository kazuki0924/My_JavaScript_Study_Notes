// Appending Variables to Strings

// Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// freeCodeCamp is awesome!
