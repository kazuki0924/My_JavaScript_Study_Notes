// Constructing Strings with Variables

// Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";


// Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?
