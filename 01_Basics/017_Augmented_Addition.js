// Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition

// In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

// myVar = myVar + 5;

// to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

// One such operator is the += operator.

// var myVar = 1;
// myVar += 5;
// console.log(myVar); // Returns 6

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

a += 12; // 15
b += 9; // 26
c += 7; // 19
