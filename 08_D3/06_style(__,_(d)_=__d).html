<!-- Change Styles Based on Data

D3 is about visualization and presentation of data. It's likely you'll want to change the styling of elements based on the data. You can use a callback function in the style() method to change the styling for different elements.

For example, you may want to color a data point blue if has a value less than 20, and red otherwise. You can use a callback function in the style() method and include the conditional logic. The callback function uses the d parameter to represent the data point:

selection.style("color", (d) => {
  /* Logic that returns the color based on a condition */
});
The style() method is not limited to setting the color - it can be used with other CSS properties as well. -->

<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];
    
    d3.select("body").selectAll("h2")
      .data(dataset)
      .enter()
      .append("h2")
      .text((d) => (d + " USD"))
      .style("color", d => d < 20 ? "red" : "green")
  </script>
</body>
